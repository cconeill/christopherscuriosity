		Mushroom Hunting at Salt point

	  	<p>
		Forage SF offers guided mushroom foraging lessons in Salt Point State Park and for Christmas my brother signed us up to spend a morning on one of these trips. It was an amazing time with a very knowledgeable teacher, Patrick Hamilton, and I learned quite a bit about mushrooms available along the coast.
		</p>
		<p>
		Patrick Hamilton strikes a very interesting balance between a kind wise old man and the mycological equivalent of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q96fdJ5F7aw">Pai Mei</a>. He is a wealth of information and very willing to share what he has learned to the curious, and fully paid, for student. Cost of the morning was $90 and there were 18 students, I would have preferred a smaller class but I suppose you have to get used to over crowding and high prices everywhere in the Bay Area, even mushroom foraging classes.
		</p>
		  <p>
		  We learned about a ton of different mushrooms, in 10 minutes we put together a beautiful collection of about 20 different species of mushrooms, but the three most common edibles that we found that day were the Midnight Blues, aka <a href="http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Entoloma_medianox.html">Entoloma medianox</a>, Shrimp Russula, aka <a href="http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Russula_xerampelina.html">Russula xerampelina</a>, and Matsutake, aka <a href="http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Tricholoma_murrillianum.html">Tricholoma murrillianum</a>. 
		  </p>
		  <a href="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/blue_side.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/blue_side.jpg"></a>
		  <a href="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/blue_gills.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/blue_gills.jpg"></a>
		  <p>
		  The Midnight blues varied from nearly black, to purple, to dark blue. I haven't tasted them yet, they took a long time to dry and were still slightly spongy even after 36 hours of drying.
		  </p>
		  <a href="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/rusulla_side.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/rusulla_side.jpg"></a>
		  <a href="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/rusulla_gills.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/rusulla_gills.jpg"></a>
		  <p>
		  Shrimp russulas, so-called due to a faint shellfish odor, ranged from small to gigantic, and were rather plain in taste. Lot's of bulk, easy to harvest and dry but nothing out of this world.
		  </p>
		  <a href="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/matsutake_side.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/matsutake_side.jpg"></a>
		  <a href="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/matsutake_gills.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/saltpoint/matsutake_gills.jpg"></a>
		  <p>
		  I only managed to find one matsutake which I've had before and quite like. I followed a recipe that Patrick had suggested to one of our fellow students, the whole kitchen team from Salt House came out that morning, marinating the matsutake in soy sauce and mirin then roasting at 400 degrees for around 15 minutes. The result was okay, it tasted fine I suppose but to me it covered up the the taste of the mushroom too much, I was hoping to taste matsutake and I only tasted soy and mirin with a hint of mushroom.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  It was an amazing morning, sometimes you have to be reminded how pleasant nature's silence is. Walking through the brush, using your nose, your eyes, your mouth, your hands, everything to learn about the world around you is such a pleasant experience it almost makes me want to deal with the headaches of car ownership just to make trips like this easier in the future. If Salt Point gets 1/2 inch of rain, expect mushrooms to start popping up about 10 days later, need to add Salt Point's weather station to my phone...

	They've arrived! First morels that I've found of the season, only managed to find a couple dozen but they have arrived.

	<p>
	This beautiful Spring day brought another surprise, bees! While moving the cows to their new paddock a local beekeeper
	stopped by and asked if he could drop off a few hives, both on the North and South side of the river. Chris agreed and
	for our trouble he gave us a whole box of honey!
	</p>
	<a href="/images/mushrooms/smallcups.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/honey.jpg"></a>
	<p>
	The beekeeper also mentioned he had a spare swarm that he didn't have a hive for and offered it to Chris, so we dumped 
	that into an available hive in the garden. Talk about a fortuitous day.

	Last year there was a small fire near I84 on top of Cabbage Hill and since I've never had the chance to 
	hunt burn morels I really wanted to do a scouting mission up there to see what I could find so I grabbed a couple
	friends and their dogs and went and had a look around. Unforunately we were either much too late or just a bit too early.
	I believe that we were a little early as there was still some snow in places and we didn't find any old morels, even if
	they're picked clean there will always be some that are missed. The plan is to go up again this weekend to check again
	and see how things are shaping up. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I took some pictures of a few mushrooms I found up there and two of them I've often seen around morels so I figured I'd
	try to identify them for future reference. Please note, I'm not a mycologist and I'm just identifying these by sight and
	smell. These small cups I believe are geopyxis vulcanalis or geopyxis carbonaria, I'm leaning towards g. vulcanalis.
	</p>
	<a href="/images/mushrooms/smallcups.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/smallcups.jpg"></a>
	<p>
	The next mushroom I see a lot around morels are these small, dark brown caps. I can't identify these at all, maybe
	something in the Entolomatacceae family? I have no idea, let me know if you do!
	</p>
	<a href="/images/mushrooms/darkcaps.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/darkcaps.jpg"></a>
	<p>
	The last mushroom I took a picture of might be the beginnings of a false morel, maybe something in the Gyromitra
	family like a gyromitra esculenta. 
	</p>
	<a href="/images/mushrooms/falsemorel.jpg"><img class="resize" src="/images/mushrooms/falsemorel.jpg"></a>
	<p>
	I love mushroom hunting, it's super fun and I have a hard time motivating myself to drive a long way out to "just hike"
	but if I'm mushroom hunting then it gives me a goal and a "reason" to get out and enjoy the woods. If you have any questions
	please get in touch, I'd love to find some more hunting partners/share tips!

	</p>
	<p>
	UPDATE: Went back up to Cabbage Hill and there were some positive signs. First I'm fairy certain now that we are still a bit early for that elevation. 
	My bet is that within two weeks we'll see some good morel harvesting. The last mushroom I thought was a false morel might not be one,
	I saw some in a more advanced stage and they turned into cups but this trip defintiely yeilded a flase morel, see below.

		When I spied a recent budget line for Industry Weapon, a digital 
		
	signage company, I was surprised at how much we paid. We have tweleve or so digital 

	signs running on various models of Cisco DMPs and it all adds up to quite a bit. 

	Xibo is an open-source digital signage solution I'd seen recommended around 

	reddit.com/r/sysadmin so I figured I'd give it a shot.I did not find the various 

	guides, link or winlink, very helpful. Neither was complete or easily followed for 

	me and it ended up at a dead end. So here is my attempt at a novice level guide 

	(could I write anything other than a novice level guide?) for setting up Xibo in a 

	Windows  environment using IIS. I tried both Ubuntu with Apache and Windows Server 

	2016 with IIS; I'm a Next-pert so Windows was much easier for me in the end. Nearly 

	our whole environment is Windows so if this ever was put into production it would 

	be Windows so it could be managed by our team, powershell is too useful and no one 

	here has any expertise in Linux. 
	</p>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Install OS environment</li>
		<li>Install pre-requesites</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>.Net Framework 3.5 and 4.X</li>
				<li>IIS</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>MySQL</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Xibo CMS</li>
		<li>Xibo Client</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Install pre-requesites
			a. Both .Net Framework 3.5 and 4.X are required. I had a 

problem installing PHP Manager and it turned out PHP Manager requires .Net 

Framework 3.5, Xibo requires 4.X and at the time of this writing 4.6.2 is the 

version I installed.
		<a href="/images/netframework.png"><img class="resize" src="/images/netframework.png"></a>
	</p>
	<p>
			b. IIS, ensure CGI under Application Development is 

checked. I'm not 100% positive a restart is required after a. and b. but I 

performed one anyway.
		<a href="/images/IIS.png"><img class="resize" src="/images/IIS.png"></a>
	</p>
	<p>
			c. PHP v5.3.28 is what I ended up installing. v7 might 

work, but it didn't on Ubuntu so when it came time to install on Windows I went 

with the v5.3 that I saw others installing. In addition I had to set
<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/W3SVC/Parameters/MajorVersion</code>

to decimal value 8 in order for PHP Manager to install. You can revert it back to 

10 after installation. (link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21216228/php-

manager-for-iis-fails-to-install)

		<a href="/images/phpinstalls.png"><img class="resize" src="/images/phpinstalls.png"></a>
		<a href="/images/majorversion.png"><img class="resize" src="/images/majorversion.png"></a>
			The following configuraiton of PHP was lifted from (link 

http://xibo.org.uk/manual/en/install_environment_windows_iis.html ), I'm not sure 

what much of this does but it's in their official documentation.
			Ensure that the below values are correct in C:\Program 

Files (x86)\PHP\v5.3\php.ini
				fastcgi.impersonate = 1
				fastcgi.logging = 0
				cgi.fix_pathinfo=1
				cgi.force_redirect=0
			Set the following values to your desired specifications, I 

set to 300 seconds and removed the ';', 256M, and 256M respectively.
				max_execution_time
				post_max_filesize
				upload_max_filesize					

		
			Restart server after making the above configuration.
	</p>
	<p>
			d. Download MySQL installer for Windows, install Server Only option. 
		<a href="/images/mysql1.png"><img class="resize" src="/images/mysql1.png"></a>
			   Select Config Type Server Machine, check Named Pipe, Shared Memory and Show Advanced Options.
		<a href="/images/mysql2.png"><img class="resize" src="/images/mysql2.png"></a>
			   Enter in root account password.
		<a href="/images/mysql3.png"><img class="resize" src="/images/mysql3.png"></a>
			   Defaults on Windows Service tab is fine.
			   Defaults for Plugins and Extensions are fine
			   Check General Log and Bin Log in Advanced Options
			   Execute and finish installation. Restart server.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Xibo CMS
			Download Xibo CMS .zip and extract it to C:\inetpub\wwwroot; rename the folder to just Xibo.
			Open IIS and select Sites>Default Web Site>Xibo then Browse*:80 (http) on the right. After all of the configuration above I recieved 
			checkmarks on all pre-requesites for installation except for File System Permissions. An exclamation point for Internationalization was received, this was 
			not important for me. To resolve the File System Permissions I ran into a bit of 
			trouble but the solution ended up being very simple, give Modify permisions to 
			Users, or whichever user will be launching IIS.
		<a href="/images/filepermissions.png"><img class="resize" src="/images/filepermissions.png"></a>
			Enter information about database
			Create library, I used C:\XiboLibrary, give modify permissions to .\Users
			You're done!

  Recently when I’ve been working in Active Directory Users and Computers in my admin VM I’ve noticed that my first interaction would take 5 or so seconds to register. A quick bit of googling suggested that disabling NETBIOS over TCP/IP would provide a quick workaround. Lo-and-behold this fixed it right up.
</p>
<p>
  Here is the interaction with NETBIOS enabled, note that first click takes around four seconds to register but subsequent clicks register normally:
  <a href="/images/Enabled NETBIOS.gif"><img class="resize" src="/images/Enabled NETBIOS.gif"></a>
</p>
<p>
  Here is the interaction with NETBIOS disabled, note that first click registers immediately:
  <a href="/images/Disabled NETBIOS.gif"><img class="resize" src="/images/Disabled NETBIOS.gif"></a>
</p>
<p> 
  To disable NETBIOS over TCP/IP just go to your NIC’s IPv4 properties, then Advanced, then, WINS, then disabled NETBIOS over TCP/IP.
