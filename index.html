		When I spied a recent budget line for Industry Weapon, a digital 

signage company, I was surprised at how much we paid. We have tweleve or so digital 

signs running on various models of Cisco DMPs and it all adds up to quite a bit. 

Xibo is an open-source digital signage solution I'd seen recommended around 

reddit.com/r/sysadmin so I figured I'd give it a shot.I did not find the various 

guides, link or winlink, very helpful. Neither was complete or easily followed for 

me and it ended up at a dead end. So here is my attempt at a novice level guide 

(could I write anything other than a novice level guide?) for setting up Xibo in a 

Windows  environment using IIS. I tried both Ubuntu with Apache and Windows Server 

2016 with IIS; I'm a Next-pert so Windows was much easier for me in the end. Nearly 

our whole environment is Windows so if this ever was put into production it would 

be Windows so it could be managed by our team, powershell is too useful and no one 

here has any expertise in Linux. 
		
		Overview
		1. Install OS environment
		2. Install pre-requesites
			a. .Net Framework 3.5 and 4.X
			b. IIS
			c. PHP
			d. MySQL
		4. Xibo CMS
		5. Xibo Client
		
		Install OS environment
		Install Windows Server 2016 with Desktop Experience.

		Install pre-requesites
			a. Both .Net Framework 3.5 and 4.X are required. I had a 

problem installing PHP Manager and it turned out PHP Manager requires .Net 

Framework 3.5, Xibo requires 4.X and at the time of this writing 4.6.2 is the 

version I installed.
		<a href="/images/netframework.png">
			<img class="resize" src="/images/netframework.png">
		</a>
			b. IIS, ensure CGI under Application Development is 

checked. I'm not 100% positive a restart is required after a. and b. but I 

performed one anyway.
		<a href="/images/IIS.png">
			<img class="resize" src="/images/IIS.png">
		</a>
			c. PHP v5.3.28 is what I ended up installing. v7 might 

work, but it didn't on Ubuntu so when it came time to install on Windows I went 

with the v5.3 that I saw others installing. In addition I had to set 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/W3SVC/Parameters/MajorVersion 

to decimal value 8 in order for PHP Manager to install. You can revert it back to 

10 after installation. (link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21216228/php-

manager-for-iis-fails-to-install)

			The following configuraiton of PHP was lifted from (link 

http://xibo.org.uk/manual/en/install_environment_windows_iis.html ), I'm not sure 

what much of this does but it's in their official documentation.
			Ensure that the below values are correct in C:\Program 

Files (x86)\PHP\v5.3\php.ini
				fastcgi.impersonate = 1
				fastcgi.logging = 0
				cgi.fix_pathinfo=1
				cgi.force_redirect=0
			Set the following values to your desired specifications, I 

set to 300 seconds and removed the ';', 256M, and 256M respectively.
				max_execution_time
				post_max_filesize
				upload_max_filesize					

		
			Restart server after making the above configuration.
			d. Download MySQL installer for Windows, install Server 

Only option. 
		<a href="/images/mysql1.png">
			<img class="resize" src="/images/mysql1.png">
		</a>
			   Select Config Type Server Machine, check Named Pipe, 

Shared Memory and Show Advanced Options.
		<a href="/images/mysql2.png">
			<img class="resize" src="/images/mysql2.png">
		</a>
			   Enter in root account password.
		<a href="/images/mysql3.png">
			<img class="resize" src="/images/mysql3.png">
		</a>
			   Defaults on Windows Service tab is fine.
			   Defaults for Plugins and Extensions are fine
			   Check General Log and Bin Log in Advanced Options
			   Execute and finish installation. Restart server.
		
		Xibo CMS
			Download Xibo CMS .zip and extract it to C:\inetpub

\wwwroot; rename the folder to just Xibo.
			Open IIS and select Sites>Default Web Site>Xibo then Browse 

*:80 (http) on the right. After all of the configuration above I recieved 

checkmarks on all pre-requesites for installation except for File System 

Permissions. An exclamation point for Internationalization was received, this was 

not important for me.
			To resolve the File System Permissions I ran into a bit of 

trouble but the solution ended up being very simple, give Modify permisions to 

Users, or whichever user will be launching IIS.
		<a href="/images/filepermissions.png">
			<img class="resize" src="/images/filepermissions.png">
		</a>
			Enter information about database
			Create library, I used C:\XiboLibrary, give modify 

permissions to .\Users
			You're done!

  Recently when I’ve been working in Active Directory Users and Computers in my admin VM I’ve noticed that my first interaction would take 5 or so seconds to register. A quick bit of googling suggested that disabling NETBIOS over TCP/IP would provide a quick workaround. Lo-and-behold this fixed it right up.
</p>
<p>
  Here is the interaction with NETBIOS enabled, note that first click takes around four seconds to register but subsequent clicks register normally:
  <a href="/images/Enabled NETBIOS.gif">
    <img class="resize" src="/images/Enabled NETBIOS.gif">
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Here is the interaction with NETBIOS disabled, note that first click registers immediately:
  <a href="/images/Disabled NETBIOS.gif"> 
    <img class="resize" src="/images/Disabled NETBIOS.gif">
  </a>
</p>
<p> 
  To disable NETBIOS over TCP/IP just go to your NIC’s IPv4 properties, then Advanced, then, WINS, then disabled NETBIOS over TCP/IP.
